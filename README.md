- My primary interest is science, physics to be precise. I eagerly read journals published on science and technology
- Technically, I am very much interested in data. I feel very much suprised while I am learning things about data such as data science, data mining concepts
- I love exploring new places, I like to travel whenever I find time

## Technical Background
Being an ECE student in my undergrad in VIT, I am fortunate to be a part of finest techincal community and understood the core of electronics. It is then I realised my interest in computers and the real-time technology where Electronics and Computers are both an integral part and started learning programming languages and cloud technologies
