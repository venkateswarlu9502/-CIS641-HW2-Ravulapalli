## Technical Background
Being an ECE student in my undergrad in VIT, I am fortunate to be a part of finest techincal community and understood the core of electronics. It is then I realised my interest in computers and the real-time technology where Electronics and Computers are both an integral part and started learning programming languages and cloud technologies
